    is the second largest planet in our solar system, nine Earth\u2019s side by side
    would be the width of Saturn. It has 53 moons and 29 waiting for confirmation.
    Another interesting fact about Saturn is that it has short days but long years,
    the day is about 10.7 hours long and the year is about 29 Earth years (10,585
    days long). Play around with the mass of Saturn to see how you can change the
    length of the year/ orbit speed."
