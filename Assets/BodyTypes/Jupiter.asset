    - <b>-162 \xB0F</b>\n\nDistance from Sun - <b>483.8 million miles</b>\n\nOrbit
    Speed - <b>13.07 km/s</b>\n\nDays in Year - <b>4,380 days</b>\n\n---\nJupiter
    is massive, about twice the size of all the other planets combined! Jupiter also
    has a lot of moons, 53 confirmed and 26 more moons waiting for confirmation.
    The planet is a gas giant, the innermost layers are made of ice, water and vapor.
    Also the year on Jupiter is about 12 Earth years (4,380 days) making the orbit
    very slow compared to Earth\u2019s orbit. Play around with the orbit speed and
    see how that changed other things!"
