    atmosphere is made up of 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen and 1 % of other materials.
    That makes it possible for Earth to support life, also since it is a rocky planet
    and mostly covered in water. Then the average surface temperatures are another
    reason why Earth is the only planet that we know of that supports life."
